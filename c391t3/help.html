<a name="Login">
<h4>Logging In:</h4></a>
<p>The login page allows a user to log in with a given userName and password.<br>
Also, if the "Use a different Database" checkbox is checked, the user can <br>
specify a specific database userName and password to log into a different database.<br></p>

<a name="Main">
<h4>Main Page:</h4></a>
<p>The main page of our website contains a header that shows if a user is logged in and <br>
a sidebar that contains links to every module that the user has permission to access.<br>
You can also click the logout link in the header to log out of the website securely.<br> 
In the next section we will talk about the areas of the website that everyone can access.<br></p>

<a name="Edit">
<h4>Edit Profile:</h4></a>
<p>A user can choose to edit their profile by selecting the "Edit Profile" link in the sidebar<br>
The edit profile page display the users current information for editing, as well as the <br>
option to change their password. If the "Change Password" checkbox is checked, then the <br>
user needs to enter their current password and a new password. If the old password is <br>
incorrect, the password will not be changed, and the system will warn the user.<br></p>
<a href="#Top">Back To Top</a>

<a name="Search">
<h4>Searching:</h4></a>
<p>The search module allows the user to search through the records available to them using a <br>
number to parameters:
<ul>
<li>Keywords: Display only the records that contain any element of the comma-separated keyword list</li>
<li>Start Date: Only view records after this date</li>
<li>End Date: Only view records before this date</li>
<li>Order By: Order the results by rank, most-recent-first or most-recent-last</li>
</ul>
To order by rank, some keywords must be given. After the parameters are given, a table will be <br>
displayed containing the results of your search. The table consists of all relevant record infomation<br>
inlcuding any images that are associated with the record. The associated images are located in the <br>
row after the record. The thumbnails of the images can be selected and the full image will display in<br>
another window.</p>

<a name="Admin">
<h3>Administration Modules</h3></a>
<p>These modules are only accessible by an administrator.</p>

<a name="Manage">
<h4>User Management:</h4></a>
<p>Upon entering the User Management module, you can either create a new user, or modify an existing user.<br>
If you choose to create a new user, you can enter their personal information, along with a username and <br>
password. After creating a new user, the user is added to the list of existing users. Choosing to edit <br>
an existing user will allow you to update their personal information, such as name, address, and password. <br>
Also, if the user is a patient, you will get a list of family doctors for that patient, and be able to add <br>
and remove doctors. If the user is a doctor, you will get a list of patients that the doctor oversees, and <br>
be able to add and remove patients. This will affect which records the doctor can view.</p>
<a href="#Top">Back To Top</a>


<a name="Report">
<h4>Report Generator:</h4></a>
<p> The report generator allows an admin to view a list of patients that have been diagnosed with a certain <br>
disease over a period of time. For this module to work, you must enter a diagnosis, start and end date, and <br>
you will be warned if you do not. The report generator will then return a list of patients that fit the <br>
criteria, including their name, address, phone number, and test date they were first diagnosed.</p>
<a href="#Top">Back To Top</a>


<a name="Olap">
<h4>Data Analysis (OLAP):</h4></a>
<p> The Data Analysis Module allows an admin to generate OLAP reports for data analysis. The admin has the <br>
choice of grouping the data by patient, test_type, and/or time. The time can be drilled down from years to <br>
months and weeks. After the admin has chosen at least one parameter, we display the OLAP data table. The table <br>
contains the criteria you requested along with the number of records that fit the criteria.</p>

<a name="Rad">
<h3>Radiologist Modules</h3></a>
<p>These modules are only accessible by a radiologist.</p>

<a name="Record">
<h4>Record Uploading:</h4></a>
<p>From the Record Uploading module, you can add a new record by filling in the form. If the information is <br>
valid, then the page will display the record id and allow you to add images to the newly created record.</p>
<a href="#Top">Back To Top</a>


<a name="Image">
<h4>Image Uploading:</h4></a>
<p>Either from the main record uploading page or after successfully adding an image or record, <br>
you can upload an image associated with a record you created. If you are uploading from the base <br>
Record Uploading module, you need to specify the record id and the image you want to add. You can <br>
only add images to a record that you entered into the database. If you are uploading after a successful <br>
upload, you do not need to reenter the record id, only the image to upload. Every image uploaded will <br>
show up in the search results. </p>
